# Data Ingestion API System

A RESTful API system designed to accept and process ingestion requests in batches, prioritize based on urgency, and respect rate limits â€” all with real-time status tracking.

### Features

1. Ingest a list of IDs with assigned priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)  
2. Automatically splits requests into batches of 3 IDs  
3. Processes one batch every 5 seconds (rate-limited)  
4. Prioritizes ingestion by priority and creation time  
5. Provides live status updates for each batch  

### How to Run Locally

cd Data_Ingestion_API_System

2. Intall dependencies
